# Description
The Cooking Social Media App is an Android application that allows users to connect with others in a cooking-themed social media environment. Users can explore a home page to see recent uploads by people they're following, search for recipes, courses, chefs, and tutorial videos, as well as watch videos from the app itself using YouTube API integration.

The application utilizes two databases. The first database stores recipes externally, allowing users to access a wide variety of recipes. The second database is active during runtime and stores user information.
